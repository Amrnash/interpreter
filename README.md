## Monkey Interpreter
Following the book [Writing an interpreter with Go](https://interpreterbook.com/), here i write it fully in typescript
and write it on my way after understanding the code provided in the book.
I added unit tests to almost every method, i found testing here is crucial and helped me a lot spotting hidden
bugs.
reading the test descriptions should explain what the code is intended to do.
this is a side project and is still under development....
